The files in this directory are templates that can be used
to create Collect forms that can be used with ODK Collect.

Note that in order to be compatible with Tables there must be a
settings sheet with "flat" set to TRUE.

It is important to point out that Collect and Tables are not perfectly
interoperable. Setting the form to flat ensures that forms can be
switched easily between different tables in Tables. However, it has
the potential to not work with certain forms, especially those employing 
field lists and repeat elements.


The forms are fed to XLSForm (http://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/).
